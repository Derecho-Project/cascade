# Cascade Service

The Cascade Service is a configurable K/V store with fast RDMA data paths. Cascade service is the easier one of the two approaches using Cascade because the application access the service through two simple APIs: (`cascade/service_client_api.hpp`)[https://github.com/Derecho-Project/cascade/blob/master/include/cascade/service_client_api.hpp] and (`cascade/service_server_api`)[https://github.com/Derecho-Project/cascade/blob/master/include/cascade/service_server_api.hpp] instead of using the more complicated native Derecho API. However, to learn how to use Cascade service, we still need to remind the group, subgroup, shard, and node concepts deriving from Derecho. Curoious users can read our [paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ken/derecho-tocs.pdf) for details on Derecho.
